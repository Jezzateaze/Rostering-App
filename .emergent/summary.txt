The previous AI engineer successfully developed a full-stack React-FastAPI-MongoDB application for workforce management, incrementally building features and resolving complex issues through an iterative feedback loop. Initial work focused on core rostering and pay calculation. Significant challenges included accurately implementing Australian SCHADS Award rules, especially the precise boundary conditions for evening rates (e.g., 20:00 vs. 20:01), and resolving persistent day-of-week mismatches between frontend display and backend calculations. The engineer consistently addressed user-reported bugs, often requiring multiple attempts and deep debugging (e.g., direct API calls, console logs) to resolve caching or logic inconsistencies. Key additions included a comprehensive break warning system, advanced shift time editing, cross-month calendar views, and robust add/remove/clear shift functionalities. The process highlighted the complexity of precise pay calculation logic and the importance of thorough end-to-end testing.

<product_requirements>
The user required a professional workforce management application for shift rostering and comprehensive pay calculations.
**Key Features Implemented:**
*   **Shift Rostering:** Calendar-based system (Monday-start) for managing staff shifts, with ability to generate, add, and remove shifts.
*   **Pay Calculation (SCHADS Award Compliance):** Accurate calculation of wages including Weekday Day (2.00/hr), Weekday Evening (4.50/hr), Weekday Night (8.50/hr), Saturday (7.50/hr), Sunday (4.00/hr), Public Holiday (8.50/hr). Specific rule: entire shift at evening rate if it *exceeds* 8:00 PM (20:01 onwards).
*   **Sleepover Allowance:** Flat rate of 75 per night (includes 2 hours wake time), with additional wake time paid at applicable hourly rates.
*   **Staff Management:** Display of 12 pre-loaded staff members, with active status and Add Staff functionality.
*   **Shift Customization:** Ability to adjust default shift templates, edit individual shift times, assign staff, and manually override shift types and hourly rates.
*   **Break Warning System:** Detects if less than a 10-hour break occurs between shifts (with sleepover exceptions), providing an approve/deny workflow.
*   **Calendar View Enhancement:** Displays previous month's shifts on the first week with a distinct background color for full 7-day continuity.
*   **UI/UX:** Professional, clean, modern interface using Shadcn UI components and Tailwind CSS.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Architecture:** Full-stack React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), MongoDB (database).
-   **Frontend:** React (components, hooks), Shadcn/ui (UI library), Tailwind CSS (styling), Axios (API calls), date-fns (date handling).
-   **Backend:** FastAPI (API framework), Pymongo/Motor (MongoDB driver), Pydantic (data validation),  (environment variables).
-   **Deployment:** Kubernetes environment with Supervisor for service management.
-   **Environment Variables:** Strict use of  and .
-   **API Design:** Backend routes prefixed with  for Kubernetes ingress.

<code_architecture>
The application is structured into  (FastAPI) and  (React) directories within the  root, following a modular design.



-   : This file contains the FastAPI application, defining all REST API endpoints.
    -   **Importance:** It's responsible for managing data persistence in MongoDB, handling all business logic for shift rostering, staff management, and intricate pay calculations (including SCHADS Award rules, various rates, and sleepover logic). It also performs break warning checks and defines data models (e.g., , ).
    -   **Changes Made:** Extensively modified to include new endpoints for adding, updating, and deleting shifts, refining pay calculation logic (e.g., accurate weekday/weekend rates, 20:01 evening rate threshold, sleepover allowance), and implementing the break warning system.
-   : The central React component that renders the main application interface.
    -   **Importance:** Manages the application's state, handles user interactions, and orchestrates data fetching and updates with the backend APIs. It dynamically renders the calendar, staff list, settings, and various dialogs for shift management.
    -   **Changes Made:** Heavily updated to integrate new UI features, including the interactive calendar with cross-month views, shift assignment dialogs with time/staff/pay adjustments, settings with SCHADS compliance toggle, shift template management, Add Shift dialog, and the Clear Roster and Delete Shift functionalities. Logic for displaying shift badges (Day, Evening, Saturday, Sunday, Sleepover) and handling manual overrides was also continuously refined.
-   : Contains global CSS styles for the application.
    -   **Importance:** Defines the visual aesthetics, ensuring a consistent and professional look according to the user's design preferences (e.g., modern color palette, spacing).
    -   **Changes Made:** Modified to implement subtle design elements like background colors for previous/next month days on the calendar and improving the visibility of interactive elements like the shift delete button.
-   : A collection of pre-built Shadcn UI components.
    -   **Importance:** These components (e.g., , , , , , ) are the building blocks of the UI, providing accessibility and a consistent design system.
    -   **Changes Made:** The engineer integrated and composed these components within  to construct the various application views and interactive elements, adhering to the always use directive for these components.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Export Functionality:** While a framework for PDF, Excel, and CSV export capabilities was mentioned, the full implementation and demonstration of working export features were not completed.
-   **Queensland Public Holiday Integration:** The integration of Queensland public holidays for shift calculations was agreed upon but not explicitly shown as implemented or verified.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was focused on resolving two persistent critical issues reported by the user: the non-functional Clear Roster button and red X shift delete functionality, and continuous problems with accurate shift type (Day, Evening, Weekend) allocations and pay rates.

**Problem Details:**
1.  **Shift Deletion & Roster Clearing (User Message 282):** The user reported that both the Clear Roster button and the individual red X delete buttons for shifts were not working.
2.  **Shift Type Allocation (User Message 212, 188, 230):** The user consistently reported incorrect shift type allocations (e.g., Saturday showing weekday rates, Sunday showing Saturday rates, Monday showing Sunday rates) despite manual overrides. This also involved the specific rule that 15:00-20:00 should be a Day shift, not Evening, unless it passed 20:00 (i.e., 20:01 onwards).

**Work Done:**
The AI engineer debugged and fixed these issues in the final series of interactions (Messages 283-308):
*   **Clear Roster & Delete Shift Fix:** The engineer confirmed the backend APIs for deleting roster entries were working. The problem was identified as frontend event handling and confirmation dialogs in . The  and  functions were updated to ensure they correctly trigger backend calls and refresh the UI, and the styling of the red X delete button was improved for visibility and clickability. The engineer's last confirmation (Message 307) stated that both functions were now working correctly! and showed the red X button on the calendar.
*   **Shift Type Allocation & Pay Rates Fix:** After multiple iterations, the engineer implemented a simplified, reliable approach for shift type logic (Messages 231-249). This involved resetting and rebuilding the logic from scratch in  and  to ensure consistent day-of-week detection and precise application of SCHADS Award rates. Direct API calls were used to verify backend calculations (e.g., Message 152 for 15:00-20:00 shift). The final status claimed (Message 249, 229) was PERFECT SHIFT TYPE CLASSIFICATION with all Saturday, Sunday, and Monday rates, along with the 15:00-20:00 evening shift boundary rule, working correctly.
*   **Manual Overrides & Sleepover:** Manual shift type override, custom hourly rate, and sleepover allowance toggle () were implemented and claimed to be working (Messages 227, 269).

The application is now claimed by the previous engineer to be completely production-ready with all reported issues resolved and features functioning as requested.
